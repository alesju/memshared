Redis-like in-memory database for NodeJS clustered applications.

**This project is still under development**. Currently only basic commands are
implemented, such as `get`, `set` and `delete`.

If you want to help, [pick one command that is not
implemented](https://github.com/endel/memshared/tree/master/src/commands) and
feel free to submit a pull-request.
